# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 0.8.0 - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **`enable_checks` config option** — Whitelist specific checks to run exclusively. Set `enable_checks` in `diesel-guard.toml` to run only the checks you care about. Cannot be combined with `disable_checks`.
- **Stdin input** — Pipe SQL directly into diesel-guard with `diesel-guard check -`. Useful for editor integrations and shell pipelines.

### Changed

- **Prebuilt binaries** — Releases now ship prebuilt binaries for all supported platforms (Linux x86_64/ARM64, macOS x86_64/ARM64, Windows x86_64) via GitHub Releases, Homebrew tap (`brew install ayarotsky/tap/diesel-guard`), and shell/PowerShell installers. No Rust toolchain required.

## 0.7.0 - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **`postgres_version` config option** — Set `postgres_version` in `diesel-guard.toml` to your target PostgreSQL major version. Checks that are safe from that version onward are skipped automatically. On PostgreSQL 11+, `AddColumnCheck` no longer flags constant defaults (boolean, integer, string literal, or NULL) since they are metadata-only changes. Custom Rhai scripts receive the config as a `config` variable and can branch on `config.postgres_version`.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-02-16

### Added

- **Custom checks via Rhai scripting** — Enforce team-specific migration conventions beyond the built-in checks. Scripts operate on the full pg_query AST, so any pattern expressible in SQL is detectable. They integrate with existing features: can be disabled via `disable_checks`, skipped inside safety-assured blocks, and included in both human-readable and JSON output.
- `dump-ast` CLI subcommand — Print the pg_query AST for a SQL statement as JSON (`diesel-guard dump-ast --sql "..."`)
- 6 example Rhai scripts: `no_unlogged_tables`, `require_concurrent_index`, `require_if_exists_on_drop`, `require_index_name_prefix`, `limit_columns_per_index`, `no_truncate_in_production`

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Switched SQL parser from `sqlparser` to `pg_query` (PostgreSQL's actual parser via libpg_query)
- Dependency updates (clap, toml, tempfile)

## 0.5.1 - 2026-02-11

### Fixed

- `check_down` setting was ignored for SQLx suffix-format `.down.sql` files — they were always checked even when `check_down = false`
- `check_down` setting was ignored when pointing at a specific migration directory

## 0.5.0 - 2026-01-19

### Added

- `ReindexCheck` - Detects `REINDEX` operations that acquire ACCESS EXCLUSIVE locks
- `GeneratedColumnCheck` - Detects `GENERATED ALWAYS AS ... STORED` columns that trigger table rewrites
- `TimestampTypeCheck` - Detects `TIMESTAMP` without time zone (recommends `TIMESTAMPTZ`)
- `CharTypeCheck` - Detects `CHAR`/`CHARACTER` column types (recommends `TEXT` or `VARCHAR`)
- `DropDatabaseCheck` - Detects `DROP DATABASE` operations
- `DropTableCheck` - Detects `DROP TABLE` operations

### Changed

- Dependency updates (colored, clap, serde_json, tempfile, thiserror)

## 0.4.0 - 2025-12-28

### Added

- SQLx framework support - Full support for all 4 SQLx migration formats
- Framework configuration - New required `framework` field in `diesel-guard.toml`
  - Valid values: `"diesel"` or `"sqlx"`
  - Explicit framework selection for clear configuration
- MigrationFile builder pattern - Cleaner API with `new()`, `with_direction()`, `with_no_transaction()`

### Changed

- Shared adapter utilities - `should_check_migration()` and `collect_and_sort_entries()` moved to shared module
- Improved CONCURRENTLY detection - Uses regex pattern matching instead of simple string contains

## 0.3.0 - 2025-12-13

### Added

- `AddJsonColumn` check - Detects adding JSON/JSONB columns without safe migration pattern
- `AddPrimaryKey` check - Detects `ALTER TABLE ... ADD PRIMARY KEY` operations
- `DropPrimaryKey` check - Detects `ALTER TABLE ... DROP CONSTRAINT` on primary keys
- `WideIndex` check - Detects indexes with excessive column count that may hurt performance
- `TruncateTable` check - Detects `TRUNCATE TABLE` operations in migrations
- `DropIndex` check - Detects `DROP INDEX` without `CONCURRENTLY` clause
- `ShortIntegerPrimaryKey` check - Detects `INTEGER` (32-bit) primary keys that risk overflow
- `AddUniqueConstraint` check - Detects `ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ... UNIQUE` operations
- GitHub Actions CI workflow for automated testing
- Parse error reporting now includes source code spans and line numbers for better debugging

### Changed

- CI toolchain locked to Rust 1.90.0 for consistent builds
- Documentation improvements including table of contents in README
- Fixed CHECK constraint naming examples to follow best practices

## 0.2.0 - 2025-12-07

### Added

- `CreateExtension` check - Detects `CREATE EXTENSION` without `IF NOT EXISTS` clause
- `UnnamedConstraint` check - Detects unnamed constraints (`CHECK`, `UNIQUE`, `FOREIGN KEY`)
- `RenameColumn` check - Detects `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME COLUMN` operations
- `AddSerialColumn` check - Detects adding `SERIAL` or `BIGSERIAL` columns to existing tables
- `RenameTable` check - Detects `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO` operations

### Removed

- `allow_unsafe` configuration option (the CLI flag `--allow-unsafe` remains available)

### Changed

- Refactoring and code improvements after v0.1 release
- CI dependency updates (actions/checkout 4→6, softprops/action-gh-release 1→2)

## 0.1.1 - 2025-12-05

### Added

- Support for multiple timestamp formats in `start_after` configuration:
  - `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` (no separators)
  - `YYYY_MM_DD_HHMMSS` (underscore separators)
  - `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS` (dash separators)
- Migration directories are now checked in alphanumeric order for deterministic results

### Fixed

- Fixed safety-assured blocks being ignored when SQL keywords appear within identifiers (e.g., `CREATE` in `CREATED_AT`)
- Statement line tracking now correctly matches whole keywords instead of prefixes

## 0.1.0 - 2025-12-05

### Added

- Initial release of diesel-guard
- Detection of unsafe PostgreSQL migration operations:
  - ADD COLUMN with DEFAULT value
  - CREATE INDEX without CONCURRENTLY
  - ALTER COLUMN TYPE changes
  - DROP COLUMN operations
  - ALTER COLUMN SET NOT NULL constraints
- Safe alternative suggestions for each detected unsafe operation
- CLI commands:
  - `check` - Analyze migration files for unsafe operations
  - `init` - Generate configuration file template
- Configuration file support (`diesel-guard.toml`):
  - `start_after` - Skip migrations before timestamp
  - `check_down` - Toggle checking down.sql files
  - `disable_checks` - Disable specific safety checks
- Safety-assured comment blocks to bypass checks for verified operations
- Multiple output formats:
  - Human-readable colored output (default)
  - JSON output for CI/CD integration
- `--allow-unsafe` flag to report without failing
- Support for single file or directory scanning
- Detailed error messages with file location and line numbers
